# BigQueryProjectCovid19
Google BigQuery Guided Project

In this guided project, I have used Google BigQuery 
in order to run queries, perform visualizations 
and create a report on 
"Novel Corona Virus (COVID-19) epidemiological data" 
compiled by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering (JHU CCSE).
and combined with the "World Bank Global Population" data.
